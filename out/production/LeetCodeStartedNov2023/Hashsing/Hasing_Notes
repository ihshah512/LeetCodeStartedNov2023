mplementation:
SET
Set:
Uniqueness:

Does not allow duplicates: A Set does not allow duplicate elements. If you attempt to add an element that is already present, the Set will ignore the duplicate.
Implementation:

Various implementations are available, such as HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
HashSet: Provides constant-time performance for basic operations but makes no guarantees about the order of elements.
LinkedHashSet: Maintains the order of elements as they are inserted.
TreeSet: Maintains elements in a sorted order.
MAP:
HashMap:
Key-Value Pairs:

Stores key-value pairs: A HashMap stores data as key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, but different keys can have the same value.
Implementation:

HashMap is a basic implementation of the Map interface.
Other implementations include LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, and others.
LinkedHashMap: Maintains the order of key-value pairs as they are inserted.
TreeMap: Sorts key-value pairs based on the natural ordering of keys or a custom comparator.

-Convert set to Array:

Integer[] numArray = numSet.toArray(new Integer[0]);
