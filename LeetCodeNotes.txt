Leet Code Notes++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Introduction to recursion
In recursion we must have a base case otherwise we would hit infinity.
In recursion function is calling itself unless functions' base case gets met
One of the example of resursion is linkedList where current node is holding
data and pointer to next node. If next node is NULL it means there are
no more elements left in the linkedList.
so there can two base cases in this scanario. E.g. if we want to add up
all the values of linked list. We can add up all the values unless a
base case of linked list not empty or next node is not NULL is met.

Arrays and strings+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- An array cant be resized. A dynamic array or list can be.
**Mutable and immutable strings:
- In java Strings are immutable. However one can use StringBuilder or
StringBuffer classes to perform mutable string operations.
Mutable is a type of data that is changeable and immutable cant be changeable
-e.g.
however in C++ strings are mutable by
default, however a keyword 'const' can be used to make string immutable
in C++. In C++ strings are implemented as a dynamic array, whose size
can be increased or decreaed.
-**Time Complexity of array and String**

-Array is a mutable DS however String is immutable. Modifying an element in array
takes O(1) time however modifying an element in String takes O(n) time

Two Pointers technique+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

sliding window technique+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Whenever a problem description talks about sub arrays,
you should figure out if sliding window is a good option by
analyzing the problem description.
If you can find the things mentioned above, then it's a good bet.
Sliding window has a TC of O(N)
